# Sign-Language-Interpreter

This project aimed at bridging the communication gap between the deaf and hearing communities. Leveraging the power of computer vision and natural language processing, the software utilizes camera input to provide real-time, accurate interpretations of sign language gestures. By seamlessly converting these gestures into text, the project is aimed at empowering deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals to express themselves with ease.
